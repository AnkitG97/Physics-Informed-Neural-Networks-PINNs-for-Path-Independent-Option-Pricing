# Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks-PINNs-for-Path-Independent-Option-Pricing
This project implements PINNs to solve the Black-Scholes PDE for vanilla options like European calls and puts. The model enforces PDE constraints during training to predict option prices without relying on traditional numerical solvers.
